# Network-based machine learning models applied to binary classification tasks using high-dimensional metabolomics data

This repository contains scripts related to the manuscript "Comparison of network-based machine learning approaches to binary classification via metabolomic data" submitted to the journal "Metabolites". Specifically, this repository contains scripts which implement five network-based machine learning models (Bayesian neural networks, feedforward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, Kolmogorov-Arnold networks, and spiking neural networks) to binary classification tasks based on high-dimensional metabolomics data. The abstract of the manuscript is pasted below.
